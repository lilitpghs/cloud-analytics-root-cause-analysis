#Explainable Root Cause Analysis for Modern Cloud Applications
Overview

This repository presents an applied analytics project focused on root cause analysis (RCA) in modern cloud-native applications using distributed tracing data and explainable machine learning.

The work explores how high-volume observability data (application traces and spans) can be transformed into actionable insights that help engineers understand which microservices contribute to failures or performance degradation, and why.

The implementation is provided as a single, end-to-end notebook reflecting the full analytical workflow, from feature construction to explainability-driven insights.
